# Using SAML 2.0



### What is SAML

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorisation credentials to service providers (SP). What that jargon means is that you can use one set of credentials to log into many different websites. Itâ€™s much simpler to manage one login per user than it is to manage separate logins to email, customer relationship management (CRM) software, Active Directory, etc.
